# 🌐 Web Platform Fix - SecureStore Issues

You're running the React Native app in a **web browser** (Expo Web), but the app is trying to use `expo-secure-store` which doesn't work in browsers.

## 🚨 Two Issues to Fix:

### 1. **Backend Server Not Running**
```bash
# Start your backend server first
cd backend
npm start
```

### 2. **SecureStore Not Compatible with Web**

## 🔧 Quick Fix Options:

### **Option A: Run on Mobile/Simulator (Recommended)**

Instead of running in web browser, use actual mobile platform:

```bash
# For iOS Simulator
npm run ios

# For Android Emulator  
npm run android
```

This will use the proper SecureStore and work as intended.

### **Option B: Fix Web Compatibility**

If you want to test in browser, the API service has been updated with cross-platform storage that automatically uses:
- **SecureStore** on mobile (secure)
- **AsyncStorage** on web (less secure but functional)

The updated `src/services/api.js` should handle this automatically.

## 🎯 Recommended Solution:

1. **Start your backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Run on iOS Simulator instead of web:**
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   ```

3. **Test the app on actual mobile platform** where SecureStore works properly

## 📱 Why Mobile Platform is Better:

- ✅ **SecureStore works** - Proper encrypted storage
- ✅ **Full React Native features** - Camera, file picker, etc.
- ✅ **Better performance** - Native components
- ✅ **Real mobile experience** - Touch gestures, navigation
- ✅ **No web compatibility issues** - All Expo modules work

## 🌐 If You Must Use Web:

The app should now work in web browser with the updated storage solution, but you'll have:
- ❌ **Less secure storage** (AsyncStorage instead of SecureStore)
- ❌ **Limited file operations** (no camera, limited file picker)
- ❌ **Web-only issues** (styling differences, performance)

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Start backend server** (`cd backend && npm start`)
2. **Run on iOS Simulator** (`npm run ios`) 
3. **Test all features** on proper mobile platform
4. **Use web only for quick debugging** if needed

The mobile experience will be much better and more representative of the final app! 📱
